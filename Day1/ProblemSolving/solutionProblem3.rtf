\f0\fs24 \cf0 Solution For number 3: \
My answers for problem 3 are as followed 10 will land on the first finger, 100 will land on the ring finger and 1000 will land on the first finger Again.\
\
I came up with this answer by following these steps. First I drew my hand and over it I Placed the numbers over the correct fingers. After finding out that multiples of tens(10, 20, 30, and etc.) landed on only the first and ring fingers I kept up with it and found the correct pattern. Also if you multiply the 10 on the first finger it goes up to 100 on the ring. Then 1000 on the first again. I went over this formula twice and literally counted in ones.}
